# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created boiler plate for Free code camp's Random Quote generator. Working on getting quote API

**Thoughts:**  I had an easy enough time with the HTML and CSS, but had a slightly hard time coming up with pseudo code for the JS. Having to do the API with javascript course on codeacademy to understand how it works.

### Day 2: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting data from APIs to show up on the page

**Thoughts:**  Working on online IDEs is posing it's own set of problems. I can't seem to get data to show up on the page without multiple errors in the console.

### Day 3: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting data from APIs to display on the page

**Thoughts:**  Spent an hour trying to get the API to work, only to realize that my code was right, but the API was not working with it. Got it to finally work with a different API. Also moved my code to Gomix since codepen can be a bit temperamental.

### Day 4: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a tweet button to the quote generator

**Thoughts:**  Took some time to find the right code to have the tweet button display. I am having a hard time figuring out exactly what to google to get the answers that I need. Moved from codepen to gomix for better online IDE flexibility.

### Day 5: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting the tweet to display the generated quote.

### Day 6: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the random quote generator

**Thoughts:**  Tweet button finally gets the quote and displays it. The background color changes when new quote is generated. This was a challenging project, but gave me more insight into how to look for the information I need.
